## This is

Scavenger hunt! Ask a question like find the best ____. Everyone shows off their item. The host UI inputs the question and options. It pushes to everyone's client where they can click to vote, then watch everyone else's votes trickle in.

Its a simple web page using material design lite. Host client pushes questions to all other clients, then each client sends a vote back to the host through web sockets.

Ultimately, a super fun way to get to know each other.

## Some warmup basic scavenger hunt questions

First 3 people to find...

- A wooden pencil
- Something living
- A succulent
